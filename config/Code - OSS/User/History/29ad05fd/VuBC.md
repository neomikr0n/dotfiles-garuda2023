# **[Environment Variables](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Environment-variables/)**
You can use the env keyword to set environment variables prior to the initialization of the Display Server, e.g.:
`env = GTK_THEME,Nord`

Can be checked with:
```
env | grep -iE '(desk|kde|gnome|xfce|lxde|gtk|QT_|cursor)'
```
3 ways of setting those up:

1. `hyprland.conf`: ️TODO: (not working atm)
    ```
    # Toolkit Backend Variables
    env = GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11
    env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
    env = CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland

    # XDG Specifications
    # XDG specific environment variables are often detected through portals and applications that may set those for you, however it is not a bad idea to set them explicitly.
    env = XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP,Hyprland
    env = XDG_SESSION_TYPE,wayland
    env = XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP,Hyprland

    # QT Variables
    env = QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR,1
    env = QT_QPA_PLATFORM,"wayland;xcb"
    env = QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION,1
    env = QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,qt5ct

    # Theming Related Variables
    env = XCURSOR_SIZE,32

    # for flameshot:
    # export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
    env = _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING,1

    # https://github.com/nosvagor/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/hyprwrap   #adendum, clean dots tho
    env = SDL_VIDEODRIVER,wayland
    env = GDK_BACKEND,"wayland,x11"
    env=CLUTTER_BACKEND,wayland

    ```
2. /etc/environment
      
    Hyprlnd wiki says:
    ```
    Please avoid putting those environment variables in `/etc/environment`. That will cause all sessions (including Xorg ones) to pick up your wayland-specific environment on traditional Linux distros. 
    ```
    It works for hyprland exclusive installations tho, just like mine:

    `sudo nano /etc/environment`: ️✔️

    ```
    # Toolkit Backend Variables
    GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11
    SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
    CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland

    # XDG Specifications
    # XDG specific environment variables are often detected through portals and applications that may set those for you, however it is not a bad idea to set them explicitly.
    XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Hyprland
    XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland
    XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=Hyprland

    # QT Variables
    QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1
    QT_QPA_PLATFORM="wayland;xcb"
    QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1
    QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

    # Theming Related Variables
    XCURSOR_SIZE=32

    # for flameshot:
    # export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
    _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

    # https://github.com/nosvagor/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/hyprwrap   #adendum, clean dots tho
    SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
    GDK_BACKEND="wayland,x11"
    CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland
    ```
3. startup script:

    ```
    # Toolkit Backend Variables
        export GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11 #- GTK: Use wayland if available, fall back to x11 if not.
        # export QT_QPA_PLATFORM="wayland;xcb" #- QT: Use wayland if available, fall back to x11 if not.
        export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland #- Run SDL2 applications on Wayland. Remove or set to x11 if games that provide older versions of SDL cause compatibility issues
        export CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland #- Clutter package already has wayland enabled, this variable will force Clutter applications to try and use the Wayland backend

    # XDG Specifications
    # XDG specific environment variables are often detected through portals and applications that may set those for you, however it is not a bad idea to set them explicitly.
        export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Hyprland
        export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland
        export XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP=Hyprland
        
    # QT Variables
        export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 #- (From the QT documentation) enables automatic scaling, based on the monitor’s pixel density
        export QT_QPA_PLATFORM="wayland;xcb" #- Tell QT applications to use the Wayland backend, and fall back to x11 if Wayland is unavailable
        export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1 #- Disables window decorations on QT applications
        export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct #- Tells QT based applications to pick your theme from qt5ct, use with Kvantum.

    # Theming Related Variables
        export XCURSOR_SIZE=32

    # for flameshot:
        # export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
        export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

    # https://github.com/nosvagor/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/hyprwrap   #adendum, clean dots tho
        export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland
        export GDK_BACKEND="wayland,x11"
        export CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland

> # **[gammarelay wl](https://github.com/jeremija/wl-gammarelay)**

---

This utility was developed from gammastep, a fork of redshift as well as examples from wlroots.
It allows using keybindings to dynamically change the color temperature and software brightness.
This used to be possible using redshift using the -P -O <temp> flags, but since wayland requires the client to keep running, I developed this tool that spins up a daemon and can be controlled via unix domain socket.
The wl-gammarelay is a daemon which listens to DBus requests:

`busctl --user -- call rs.wl-gammarelay / rs.wl.gammarelay UpdateTemperature n -500 busctl --user -- call rs.wl-gammarelay / rs.wl.gammarelay UpdateTemperature n +500 busctl --user -- set-property rs.wl-gammarelay / rs.wl.gammarelay Temperature q 4000 busctl --user -- set-property rs.wl-gammarelay / rs.wl.gammarelay Temperature q 6500`

The service can be introspected:
`busctl --user introspect rs.wl-gammarelay / rs.wl.gammarelay`

🔴 JUST FOR SYSTEMD-BOOT **NOT GRUB!**

##### [ARCH:](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Plymouth) Plymouth is a project from Fedora and now listed among the freedesktop.org's official resources providing a flicker-free graphical boot process. It relies on kernel mode setting (KMS) to set the native resolution of the display as early as possible, then provides an eye-candy splash screen leading all the way up to the login manager.

>>>
>>

Didn't see this mentioned anywhere and this was one of the top search results related to adding Xfce custom actions, so...

If anyone wants to add entries to Thunar's right-click/context menu BUT wants to avoid the GUI for some reason, here is what worked for me. In my case, I wanted to do this as part of a post-install setup script that could be run on multiple computers.

It appears that adding things via the GUI mentioned in the other answers saves to the file `~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml`. Under Fedora 35 Xfce / Thunar 4.16.10, this had a sample entry for "Open Terminal Here" by default.

For me, this file contained (before modifying):

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<actions>
<action>
    <icon>utilities-terminal</icon>
    <name>Open Terminal Here</name>
    <unique-id>1644974544355345-1</unique-id>
    <command>exo-open --working-directory %f --launch TerminalEmulator</command>
    <description>Example for a custom action</description>
    <patterns>*</patterns>
    <startup-notify/>
    <directories/>
</action>
</actions>
```

Adding another <action>...</action> section with the appropriate details before the closing </actions> tag seemed to work as expected for me.

For example, I added:

```
<action>
    <icon>org.gnome.Meld</icon>
    <name>Compare selected</name>
    <unique-id>1654579259785630-2</unique-id>
    <command>meld %F</command>
    <description>Compares selected files or folders in Meld</description>
    <patterns>*</patterns>
    <directories/>
    <text-files/>
</action>
```

And was then able to see an option for doing Meld comparisons when I selected multiple files/folders. You might need to have the target app already installed for it to work (I already had meld installed).

Thunar picked the changes up right away for me after I closed open instances but if not, then you may need to kill/restart thunar (e.g. pkill -if thunar) or restart the pc for the changes to take effect.

I will likely just copy the file after I have it set up but if I decide to make a function wrapping xmlstarlet etc commands for this, then I'll try to remember to post a copy here as well.

>>> [Meld custom action in Thunar](https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?id=9660)
>>>
>>

you can create the two custom action in Thunar: for the first I choose the Name "Meld: select first", you can type what you prefer. The command is:

`echo -n %f | xclip`

For the second custom action I set the name "Meld: select second and compare" and the command:

`xclip -o | xargs -r -I '{}' meld '{}' %f`

For both, on the "Appearance Conditions" tab I set

File pattern: *

Appears if selection contains: Directories, Text files, Other files

###### **systemctl suspend** – Use systemd to suspend/hibernate from command line on Linux. Most modern Linux distro only needs to use the systemctl command.

###### **pm-suspend** – During suspend most devices are shutdown, and system state is saved in RAM. The system still requires power in this state. Most modern systems require 3 to 5 seconds to enter and leave suspend, and most laptops can stay in suspend mode for 1 to 3 days before exhausting their battery.

###### **pm-hibernate** – During hibernate the system is fully powered off, and system state is saved to disk. The system does not require power, and can stay in hibernate mode indefinitely. Most modern systems require 15 to 45 seconds to enter and leave hibernate, and entering and leaving hibernate takes longer when you have more memory.

###### **pm-suspend-hybrid** – Hybrid-suspend is the process where the system does everything it needs to hibernate, but suspends instead of shutting down. This means that your computer can wake up quicker than for normal hibernation if you do not run out of power, and you can resume even if you run out of power.

## 1. list down all the file systems by using this command

`lsblk -l`

## 2. let's do this then: sudo mount NameOfFileSystem MountPoint

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /run/media/n30/BLACKY01
sudo umount /dev/nvme0n1p1

## 3. mount it at the startup

### Or use these:
cat -n /etc/fstab

sudo fdisk -l

sudo /sbin/tune2fs -l /dev/nvme0n1p4
sudo /sbin/tune2fs -l /dev/nvme1n1p1

sda

### another option, messy tho:
`blkid`:

/dev/sda2: *LABEL="chivos_4t" UUID="6483-8269"* BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="exfat" PARTUUID="ce0226f9-8128-42b0-b40c-40f416ee03f8"

/dev/zram0: LABEL="zram0" UUID="39231984-0c1a-4865-b7f3-db863ab15fb2" TYPE="swap"

### concise way when you know the device:
`blkid /dev/sda2`
/dev/sda2: LABEL="chivos_4t" UUID="6483-8269" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="exfat" PARTUUID="ce0226f9-8128-42b0-b40c-40f416ee03f8"

## 4. let's edit fstab:
`sudo nano /etc/fstab`

UUID=98265bf8-8c98-4a94-b708-c150a40606b3 /run/media/n30/BLACKY01 ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=cf42ea71-973a-47cd-ab6e-7e0e167fa934 /run/media/n30/nvme_chivos ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=6483-8269       /run/media/n30/chivos_4t ext4 defaults 0 0

## 5. We always want to test the fstab before rebooting (an incorrect fstab can render a disk unbootable).  To test do:

findmnt --verify
systemctl daemon-reload

## Imgur API
### Register an Application (IMPORTANT)
Each client must register their application and receive the client_id and client_secret.

For public read-only and anonymous resources, such as getting image info, looking up user comments, etc. all you need to do is send an authorization header with your client_id in your requests. This also works if you'd like to upload images anonymously (without the image being tied to an account), or if you'd like to create an anonymous album. This lets us know which application is accessing the API.
Plain Text

Authorization: Client-ID

Registration Quickstart
If you are just getting started, an easy way to explore the endpoints is by creating an application using following instructions below.

    1. Download/Register/Sign-up on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and click the **Run in Postman** button at the [top of this page](https://apidocs.imgur.com/). This will load our collection of endpoints into Postman for easy debugging.
    2. Import the data to "[My workspace](https://gold-equinox-599447.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~384271e5-ee01-4eb7-89aa-5fe39e7fe597/collection/27179996-d64957ce-9b8b-4d89-9944-2998884e12b2)"
    3. [Register your application](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) (named ksnip)using the "Authorization callback URL" postman callback URL: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
    4. In Postman, under the main request builder panel, click the Authorization tab. Click the Get New Access Token button. Set Auth URL to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize and Access Token URL to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token. Add the Client ID and Client Secret you received from registering your application above, then click Request Token
    5. After logging in and granting access to your application, you should receive a refresh token.
    6. Copy this refresh token, then click the gear icon in the top right of Postman. Click Manage Environments then Add, and add the refreshToken, clientId, and clientSecret fields as shown below
    7. 
    8. Inside the Account folder, run the Generate Access Token endpoint. The response you receive will give you an access token which will be valid for about a month. This token is automatically saved to your Postman environment via the JavaScript test for that endpoint as seen below. Whenever your token expires, just re-run this endpoint and a new token will be saved to your environment.
    Run any endpoint within the collection. You have authorized your app and logged in with your username, so you are now making authenticated requests against the Imgur API. Happy hacking!

    Open User Settings or shortcut key `[Control + ,]`
    Copy following User Settings to configure Visual studio code to use fish shell as default:

  `"terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/usr/bin/fish" `
  Terminal > External

- ## Changing the default path of Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal
  go to: `Menu File → Preferences → Settings`
  using the "Search Settings" bar across the top of the window paste or type this:  `terminal.integrated.cwd` and set whatever path you need.


- ## Set `Jetbrain Mono Font` in Visual Studio Code

  - In VS Code, use the command palette (ctrl + shift + p) to open the JSON version of the editor’s settings.

  - Then set the editor.fontFamily setting to JetBrains Mono and if you want the awesome ligatures as well, set editor.fontLigatures to true:
    ```
    "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
    ```
  - Save the file

- ## still not showing the propper unicode?

  - Try moving the files to (create the directory if it doesn't exist) on:

  ~/.local/share/fonts/
  /usr/share/fonts/

  - then run  to refresh the fonts

  fc-cache -fv

  - restart vscode

  - if not working, restart linux

- change default browser to firedragon

  - install extension "Live Server"

  - open configurations, press Ctrl + ,

  - search for "browser" on the extension configurations

  - Live Server › Settings: Custom Browser = NULL

  - Live Server › Settings: Advance Custom Browser = "Edit in settings.json" then edit these line:

    `"liveServer.settings.AdvanceCustomBrowserCmdLine": "firedragon",`

- ############### Run selected text ####################

  To use the runSelectedText command, select text in an editor and run the command Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), the terminal will attempt to run the selected text. If no text is selected in the active editor, the entire line that the cursor is on will run in the terminal.

- transparent

  to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

```
[archlinuxcn]
Server = https://repo.archlinuxcn.org/$arch

garuda-update && sudo pacman -S archlinuxcn-keyring

yay -S archlinuxcn/code-transparent
```

## Troubleshooting


https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/code-transparent.install?h=code-transparent

If Code is not shown transparent:
1. Ensure color setting of Code is configured with transparent colors. (See "Config" section below)

~/.config/Code - OSS/User/settings.json

2. Ensure your compositor has transparency enabled.

3. Open a second Code window. (Sometimes works)

## Configs

Although Code is transparency-enabled, Code needs to be configured with transparent colors to see the transparency effect. You can configure each color by yourself, or start with an already transparent color config. Consider copying below color config to your Code `settings.json`:

```
{
"window.zoomLevel": 1,

"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
// non-standard, transparency patched version only
"workbench.background": "#00000080",

// VSC colors

sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
sudo pacman -S git

## let's clone AUR repository

```
cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://AUR.archlinux.org/visual-studio-code-bin.git

cd visual-studio-code-bin/ && makepkg -s

#Now run the following command to install the generated pacman package:

## Selecting the Color Theme

In VS Code, open the Color Theme picker with File > Preferences > Color Theme. Or Ctrl+K Ctrl+T to display the picker.
Use the cursor keys to preview the colors of the theme.
Select the theme you want and press Enter.

## Color Themes from the Marketplace
You can search for themes in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) search box using the @category:"themes" filter.

# [GRUB]()

---

## Tips

- To extract the tar file use `tar -xvf pentract.tar.xz` Or else use the unzip filename command to extract the zip file.

- To customize the font colors edit the color property in the theme.txt file

- In case of permission denied right click and change the property of install.sh file to enable and run as program option.

Then re-run the install.sh script

- Press C in the grub bootloader screen and type vbeinfo to know the supported resolutions of the system.

- Modify grub bootloader screen resolution:

- First type sudo nano /etc/default/grub in the terminal

- Find the line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 which is the default resolution

- Then remove the # and change the 640x480 with your preferred mode

Example GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x960

- Save it by pressing Ctrl+o and exit Ctrl+x

- Then type sudo update-grub


## Themes:

1. Choose one:
   - [Pentract](https://github.com/sarancodes/pentract-grub-theme)

   cd ~/Downloads && wget https://github.com/sarancodes/pentract-grub-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip main.zip

   To uninstall use sudo ./uninstall.sh command

   - [MINECRAFT](https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme)

   cd /boot/grub/themes/ && sudo git clone https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme.git

   change/add this line in your /etc/default/grub:
   GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub2/themes/minegrub-theme/theme.txt

   sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

   - [CyberRe 1.0.0](https://store.kde.org/p/1420727)
   mv /home/n30/Downloads/CyberRe /boot/grub/themes/

2. Edit grub txt and add:

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub/themes/CyberRe/theme.txt
    GRUB_GFXMODE="1920x1080x32"
    ```
3. "Garuda Boot" to remove splash screen (ugh!) and then apply, this should update the grub.

4. Maybe force it to update is neccesary?

    sudo update-grub

5. Maybe rebuild grub?

    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg --> reconfigure

  2. about:preferences

  3. search "font"

  4. use JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

- Loading ALL TABS at the beginning
    ```
    about:preferences
    General > Startup
    Open previous windows and tabs  # check this option
    ``` 


- Disable custom fonts: 

  Go to the Firefox menu and select "Options" or "Preferences". Then, click on the "Language and Appearance" tab and scroll down to the "Fonts and Colors" section. Click on the "Advanced" button next to "Fonts" and uncheck the box next to `"Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of my selections above"`. This works for todoist spaced font for example.

- To check whether [Firefox is reading your system time properly](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1253204), Open Firefox's Web Console using either:

      - "3-bar" menu button > Web Developer > Web Console
      - (menu bar) Tools > Web Developer > Web Console
      - (Windows) Ctrl+Shift+k 

    Then type or paste the following script next to the caret (») and press Enter to execute it:

    `new Date().toString();`

    The first time you use the console, Firefox may ask you to take action to confirm. Mine was:
    `"Tue Apr 25 2023 05:42:03 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"`
    If isn't correct, set to false resist fingerprinting (check down here): 👇

- settings need to be set to ***TRUE*** in `about:config`
  ```
  # create the entry if it doesnt exists, set it to true:
  xdg.use-xdg-desktop-portal 
  ```


- settings need to be set to ***FALSE*** in `about:config`

  🏆
  # When [resist fingerprinting](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1253204) (RFP) is enabled then some items are spoofed (TimeZone: UTC, etc), so let's disable it:

- How to [Manually Install Extensions](https://avoidthehack.com/manually-install-extensions-ungoogled-chromium) (Ungoogled Chromium, Chrome)


1. Open any browser of your choice (doesnt have to be Chromium based)
2. Click here https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store/releases
3. Download the file Chromium.Web.Store.crx
4. Save Chromium.Web.Store.crx
5. Open your Chromium browser. Again, Im using Ungoogled Chromium here, but any Chromium-based browser should do the trick.
6. In the address bar, type chrome://flags/#extension-mime-request-handling
7. Change Handling of extension MIME type requests to Always prompt for ins. (This makes it more user friendly to install .crx files, which are the packed version of chromium extensions)
8. Now, in the address bar, type chrome://extensions like so:
9. ￼In the top right, enable Developer mode (hint: its enabled when you can see buttons for "Load unpacked" and "Pack extension.")
10. Open an explorer window on your PC. Navigate to the folder where you saved Chromium.Web.Store.crx
11. Drag Chromium.Web.Store.crx to your Chromium browser

  Your version of Firefox may be using the multiprocess feature already. Follow these instructions to make sure:

   about:support
  1. In Multiprocess Windows, if the number is higher than zero (0), you already have the multiprocess feature activated.
  2. 
  3. If the number is zero (0), follow these instructions to turn it on:
        1. about:config
        2. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.
        3. Search for browser.tabs.remote.autostart and double-click on the preference to set its value to true.

- [File dialogs do not open when downloading files](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/firefox)

6.33 If no file chooser is shown when downloading files, even with the option "Always ask where to save files" enabled in Firefox's preferences, then you might not have both xdg-desktop-portal and a suitable implementation. Desktop environments usually provide an implementation, but if you are using a standalone window manager such as i3, then you may need to manually install one. Install xdg-desktop-portal and for example `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`. (Worked on Hyprland!)

## [Hyprland tweak/hack](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/App-Clients/#spotify)

Spotify **does not follow window rules**. This is because the client sets its class after the window has opened, thus making it “immune” to windowrules. An alternative to Spotify’s GUI client is `spotify-tui` which can be launched in a terminal with a custom class. While limited in functionality, it is quite powerful and could be preferred over the GUI client. Another alternative is ncspot, a powerful cross-platform ncurses Spotify client written in Rust.

Some users have also reported installing [spotifywm](https://github.com/amurzeau/spotifywm) has resolved the issue. The original repository by dasJ is no longer working because of some changes made in the newer Spotify version, and until the pull request gets merged, amurzeau's fork does the job.

After following the installation paragraph on the README, start Spotify with:

`LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/spotifywm.so spotify`

The path MUST be the absolute one. If it’s not, the hack will not work.Now you can freely manage your Spotify client. Always use class to manage the window. For example:

```
windowrulev2 = tile, class:^(Spotify)$
windowrulev2 = workspace 9, class:^(Spotify)$
```

## Themes:

### [purple_Lines](https://github.com/JamesIsWack/purple_Lines)
Modified version of Retroblur Spicetify theme.

### [Retroblur](https://github.com/Motschen/Retroblur)
```
cd ~/Downloads && \
wget https://github.com/Motschen/Retroblur/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
cp /Retroblur ~/.dotfiles/spicetify/Themes/ \
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 current_theme Retroblur color_scheme purple && \
spicetify apply
```
To change the color of the background, edit the link on the first line of **user.css**
`/home/n30/.dotfiles/spicetify/Themes/Retroblur/user.css`, [like this one](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/64/b6/0964b64d7c0a214da7efb4e4ee7959c7.jpg):

Its sadly not possible to change the background together with the color scheme automatically due to the limitations of CSS.

- ### [DefaultDynamic](https://github.com/JulienMaille/spicetify-dynamic-theme) for Spicetify
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulienMaille/spicetify-dynamic-theme/master/install.sh | sh
spicetify apply
```

- ### [Frostify](https://github.com/Ramlord/Frostify): (not worked!)
```
cd ~/Downloads && wget http://github.com/Ramlord/Frostify/releases/download/0.1/Frostify.zip
cp /Frostify ~/.config/spicetify/Themes/
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 0 overwrite_assets 1 replace_colors 0 current_theme Frostify && spicetify apply
```

spicetify backup apply

nano ~/.config/spicetify/config-xpui.ini

Restart Spotify

- ### he4rt theme (not worked!)

```
cd ~/.config/spicetify/Themes/ && git clone https://github.com/aleDsz/he4rt-spicetifyy-theme.git he4rt
cd he4rt
cp he4rt.js ~/.config/spicetify/Extensions
spicetify config extensions he4rt.js inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 current_theme he4rt color_scheme base && spicetify apply

spicetify config extensions catppuccin-macchiato.js inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 current_theme catppuccin-macchiato && spicetify apply
```


- ### [BLoom theme](https://github.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom)

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom/main/install.sh | bash
```

or installing it manually:
```
spicetify config current_theme bloom color_scheme purple && \
spicetify apply
```

- ### "accented" theme:
```
cd "$(spicetify -c | Split-Path)\Themes"

cd ~/.config/spicetify/Themes && git clone https://github.com/luximus-hunter/accented
spicetify config current_theme accented color_scheme purple && spicetify apply
```

- ### [moar tHEMES](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes) (optional)
 
```
cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes.git && cd spicetify-themes
```

Copy the files into the Spicetify Themes folder. Run:
```
cp -r * ~/.config/spicetify/Themes
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
```
Choose which theme to apply just by running:
```
spicetify config current_theme THEME_NAME
```
Some themes have 2 or more different color schemes. After selecting the theme you can switch between them with:
```
spicetify config color_scheme SCHEME_NAME

spicetify config current_theme Ziro color_scheme purple-dark  && spicetify apply
spicetify config current_theme Ziro color_scheme rose-pine-moon  && spicetify apply

spicetify config current_theme Flow color_scheme Violet && spicetify apply

spicetify config current_theme Sleek color_scheme Elementary  && spicetify apply

spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
spicetify config extensions dribbblish.js
spicetify config current_theme Dribbblish color_scheme purple && spicetify apply

```

- Make sure you do not have amdvlk (having it installed will cause a lot of issues):
```
sudo pacman -R amdvlk
```

## 2. Add required core packages

- These packages are all required for our releases to work, if you dont have them the games will not run.
```
sudo pacman -S --needed rumpowered/dwarfs fuse-overlayfs wine-staging wine-mono openssl-1.1
```

## 3. Add graphics packages for your set up.

- GPU/APU Drivers required for AMD GPUs
```
sudo pacman -S --needed lib32-vulkan-radeon vulkan-radeon
```

## 4. Install additional libraries

- Some games require additional libaries to run successfully. We strongly recommend the following libraries are installed.

sudo pacman -S --needed lib32-alsa-lib lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-libpulse lib32-openal giflib libgphoto2 libxcrypt-compat zlib gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly gst-plugins-bad gstreamer-vaapi gst-libav

## 5. OPTIONAL 
- Prevent non-LAN activity by default. It is recommended that you prevent access to the WAN for our releases.
```
sudo pacman -S --needed rumpowered/bindtointerface rumpowered/lib32-bindtointerface
```
- wine-staging-tkg can be used instead of wine-staging, to the user's choice

```
sudo pacman -S --needed wine-staging wine-mono \
lib32-giflib lib32-gnutls lib32-libxcomposite lib32-libxinerama lib32-libxslt lib32-mpg123 lib32-v4l-utils lib32-alsa-lib lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-libpulse lib32-openal lib32-zlib giflib libgphoto2 libxcrypt-compat zlib gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly gst-plugins-bad gstreamer-vaapi gst-libav \

To run steaL, in your command line type:
steal

after first run, the directory ~/.config/steal will be created it contains 2 files `conf.json` and `library.csv`

`conf.json` has two parameters:

```
{
    "lib_path": "/home/USER/Games", <-- default path to save the downloaded games is Games dir in your user's home, change it to whatever
    "num_of_cards": "50" <-- number of games displayed in Browse tab
}
```
`library.csv` contains info about the games you download { name, cover url and launching script }

Usage: just search for the game you want and download it, wait until it finish extracting {zpaq takes time to extract, be patient}

after it's done just click the update button to update the library and your game will be there to launch a game just click on it.  Enjoy!!

## it takes two jc141

To fix the language on it takes two, run `bash settings.sh` mount-dwarfs then go to `files/groot` and edit the file `codex.cfg`. where you see `ru_RU` replace with `en_US`.

The earlier torrent also had a black screen issue. you can just can the script from the new torrent and it will be fixed as well

# ELDEN RING wine ------------------------------------

## add in symbolic links from your WINEPREFIX to the root of a mounted drive, or subdirectory, you want to mount as a Wine virtual Windows drive.

cd "${WINEPREFIX:-${HOME}/.wine}/dosdevices"

ln -s "/run/media/n30/SSD_Chivos/linuxsaurio/" "y:"

!!
You can also do with the winecfg "Drives" tab.

Typically all mounted system drives are also accessible via Z:\, which maps to the Unix / root directory.

## - To have systemd automatically start swhkd for you:
  -  Copy hotkeys.sh into your preferred directory
  -  chmod +x hotkeys.sh
  -  Copy hotkeys.service into your $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/systemd/user directory
    Using a text editor, uncomment line 7 of hotkeys.service and change the path accordingly
  -  In a terminal: systemctl --user enable hotkeys.service

```
cp ~/Downloads/hotkeys.sh ~/.dotfiles/bin
chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/bin/hotkeys.sh
cp ~/Downloads/hotkeys.service /usr/lib/systemd/ ????
journalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd ????
```

## - Configuration file
Swhkd closely follows sxhkd syntax, so most existing sxhkd configs should be functional with swhkd.

The default configuration file is in `/etc/swhkd/swhkdrc`. If you don't like having to edit the file as root every single time, you can create a symlink from `~/.config/swhkd/swhkdrc` to `/etc/swhkd/swhkdrc`:

```
mkdir ~/.config/swhkd/
mkdir /etc/swhkd/
touch ~/.config/swhkd/swhkdrc
sudo ln -s ~/.config/swhkd/swhkdrc /etc/swhkd/swhkdrc
```
If you use Vim, you can get swhkd config syntax highlighting with the `swhkd-vim plugin`. Install it in vim-plug with Plug `waycrate/swhkd-vim`.

All supported key and modifier names are listed in man 5 swhkd-keys.

## - Runtime signals:
After opening swhkd, you can control the program through signals:

    sudo pkill -USR1 swhkd - Pause key checking
    sudo pkill -USR2 swhkd - Resume key checking
    sudo pkill -HUP swhkd - Reload config file

ExecStart=/usr/bin/swhkd

# evtest

`yay -S evtest`

To see the Wayland events generated when a key is pressed first, you'll need to determine the device node for your keyboard. You can do this by running the sudo `libinput list-devices` command and looking for your keyboard device in the list. Once you've identified the device node, you can use it with the evtest command.

```
sudo evtest /dev/input/event3

* [Binds WIKI for Hyprland:](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/)

  * **Uncommon syms / binding with a keycode:** See the [xkbcommon-keysyms.h](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h) header for all the keysyms. ~~The name you should use is the one after XKB_KEY_, written in all lowercase, e.g.: `XKB_KEY_Caps_Lock` will become `caps_lock`~~

    If you are unsure of what your key’s name is, you can use ~~`xev` or~~ `wev` to find that information.
    ~~If you want to bind by a keycode, you can just input it in the KEY position with a code: prefix, e.g. for capslock: `bind=SUPER,code:66,exec,$test`~~
  * You can **bind a mod alone** like this: `bindr=ALT,Alt_L,exec,$test`

    Or for a scratchpad binded on SUPER: `bindr = $mainMod, $mainMod_L, togglespecialworkspace,`
  * **Global Keybinds:**
    Let’s take OBS as an example: the “Start/Stop Recording” keybind is set to SUPER + F10, and you want to make it work globally.
    `bind = SUPER,F10,pass,^(com\.obsproject\.Studio)$`
  * **push-to-talk** will work flawlessly with one pass, e.g.:
    `bind=,mouse:276,pass,^(TeamSpeak 3)$`
    Will pass `MOUSE5` to TeamSpeak3 because "`pass`" will pass the PRESS and RELEASE events by itself, no need for a bindr.

- ## [Force apps to use Wayland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/#force-apps-to-use-wayland)

A lot of apps will use Wayland by default. Chromium (and other browsers based on it or electron) don’t. You need to pass `--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland` to them or use `.conf` files where possible. Chromium-based browsers also should have a toggle in `chrome://flags`. Search for “ozone” and select Wayland.

For most electron apps, you should put the above in `~/.config/electron-flags.conf`. VSCode is known to not work with that though.

A few more environment variables for forcing Wayland mode are documented here.You can check whether an app is running in xwayland or not with `hyprctl clients`.

- ## hyprland dpms terminal command for turning off display 3

To turn off a specific display connected to your Hyperland system using the DPMS (Display Power Management System), you can use the xset command.

First, you need to identify the name of the display you want to turn off. You can do this by running the `xrandr` command without any arguments, which will display a list of all connected displays and their current status.

Once you have identified the name of the display you want to turn off, you can use the following command to turn it off using DPMS:

xset dpms force off && sleep 1 && xrandr --output DP-3 --off

This command will turn off the specified display using DPMS, which puts the display into a low-power state, and then turns off the display using xrandr.

Note that turning off a display using DPMS does not shut down your computer or terminate your terminal session. It only turns off the display. To turn the display back on, you can use the same xrandr command with the --auto option, or press a key or move the mouse.

`~/.local/share/chezmoi`: source directory where chezmoi stores its source state.
```
chezmoi add ~/Documents/deleteme.md

official:

> `yay -s chezmoi`
> 


## [Start using chezmoi on your current machine](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/#start-using-chezmoi-on-your-current-machine)

```
chezmoi init
```
This will create a new git local repository in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` where chezmoi will store its source state. By default, chezmoi only modifies files in the working copy.

Manage your first file with chezmoi:

```
chezmoi add ~/.bashrc
chezmoi add ~/Documents/deleteme.md

```
This will copy `~/.bashrc` to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc`.

Edit the source state:

```
chezmoi edit ~/Documents/deleteme.md
chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc
chezmoi edit ~/.config/swaync/config.json

```
This will open `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_bashrc` in your `$EDITOR`. Make some changes and save the file.

See what changes chezmoi would make:

```
chezmoi diff
```
Apply the changes:

```
chezmoi -v apply
```
All chezmoi commands accept the -v (verbose) flag to print out exactly what changes they will make to the file system, and the -n (dry run) flag to not make any actual changes. The combination -n -v is very useful if you want to see exactly what changes would be made.

Next, open a shell in the source directory, to commit your changes:

```
chezmoi cd
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
## Create a new repository on GitHub called dotfiles and then push your repo:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/neomikr0n/dotfiles.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```


chezmoi init --apply --verbose https://github.com/neomikr0n/dotfiles.git

  ### [Preview Images ](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/Previews#with-kitty-and-pistol)With Kitty and Pistol

  The following setup will use kitty to display images, and fall back to pistol for everything else. This also works with the wezterm or Konsole terminal.

  As usual, we'll specify a previewer and a cleaner in `~/.config/lf/lfrc`:
  ```
  set previewer ~/.config/lf/lf_kitty_preview
  set cleaner ~/.config/lf/lf_kitty_clean
  ```

  The cleaner script is ~/.config/lf/lf_kitty_clean:
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  kitty +kitten icat --clear --stdin no --silent --transfer-mode file < /dev/null > /dev/tty
  ```
  And the previewer is at ~/.config/lf/lf_kitty_preview:
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  file=$1
  w=$2
  h=$3
  x=$4
  y=$5

  if [[ "$( file -Lb --mime-type "$file")" =~ ^image ]]; then
      kitty +kitten icat --silent --stdin no --transfer-mode file --place "${w}x${h}@${x}x${y}" "$file" < /dev/null > /dev/tty
      exit 1
  fi

  pistol "$file"
  ```
  Don't forget to mark the files as executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/lf/lf_kitty_{clean,preview}`

  As with the setups above, you can integrate ffmpegthumbnailer into the previewer to it to support videos. The following modification, for example, uses the vidthumb script:
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  file=$1
  w=$2
  h=$3
  x=$4
  y=$5

  filetype="$( file -Lb --mime-type "$file")"

  if [[ "$filetype" =~ ^image ]]; then
      kitty +kitten icat --silent --stdin no --transfer-mode file --place "${w}x${h}@${x}x${y}" "$file" < /dev/null > /dev/tty
      exit 1
  fi

  if [[ "$filetype" =~ ^video ]]; then
      # vidthumb is from here:
      # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duganchen/kitty-pistol-previewer/main/vidthumb
      kitty +kitten icat --silent --stdin no --transfer-mode file --place "${w}x${h}@${x}x${y}" "$(vidthumb "$file")" < /dev/null > /dev/tty
      exit 1
  fi

  pistol "$file"
  ```

- ## [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui):
  A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.

  `yay -S spotify-tui`
  spotify-tui needs to connect to Spotify’s API in order to find music by name, play tracks etc.


    ### How to get setup:

  1.    Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
  2.    Click Create an app
  3.    You now can see your Client ID and Client Secret
  4.    Now click Edit Settings
  5.    Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
  6.    Scroll down and click Save
  7.    You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
  8.    Go back to the terminal
  9.    Run `spt`
  10.   Enter your Client ID: `94809121fc5647909a211fd9da683186`
  11.   Enter your Client Secret: `d995704ae27a40fbb07950cd17587b24`
  12.   Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port
      You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
      After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you're done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you'll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.
      And now you are ready to use the spotify-tui tada

      You can edit the config at anytime at ${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml. ~~(for snap ${HOME}/snap/spt/current/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml)~~

First, you need to enable sddm.service and restart Arch Linux.
```
systemctl enable sddm
systemctl reboot
```
By enabling the 'sddm.service', sddm login greeter will always be shown.


## [Autologin](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM)

SDDM supports automatic login through its configuration file, for example:

`nano /etc/sddm.conf.d/autologin.conf`
```
[Autologin]
User=n30
Session=hyprland
```
Available session types can be found in /usr/share/xsessions/ for X and in /usr/share/wayland-sessions/ for Wayland.

# **[Gromit-MPX](https://github.com/bk138/gromit-mpx)**
Gromit-MPX is an on-screen annotation tool.
Its main use is for making presentations of some application. 

# **[𝑋𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑝](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap)**
xremap is a key remapper for Linux. Unlike xmodmap, it supports app-specific remapping and Wayland.


Features:

  - Remap any keys, e.g. Ctrl or CapsLock.
  Remap any key combination to another, even to a key sequence.
  - Remap a key sequence as well. You could do something like Emacs's C-x C-c.
  - Remap a key to two different keys depending on whether it's pressed alone or held.
  - Application-specific remapping. Even if it's not supported by your application, xremap can.
    - Automatically remap newly connected devices by starting xremap with --watch.
    Support Emacs-like key remapping, including the mark mode.
    - Trigger commands on key press/release events.
    - Use a non-modifier key as a virtual modifier key.


# **[Ianny](https://github.com/zer0-x/iann)**
Simple, light-weight, easy to use, and effective Linux Wayland desktop utility helps preventing repetitive strain injuries RSI by keeping track of usage patterns and periodically informing user to take breaks.

git clone https://github.com/zer0-x/ianny.git
cd ianny

Checkout to a release tag e.g. v1.0.1
git checkout vx.x.x

meson build
meson compile -C build
You will find the binary in ./build/src/ianny

To install:
meson install -C build



# **[xsettingsd](https://github.com/derat/xsettingsd)**
xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.

Some GTK applications running via XWayland, and some Java applications, need an XSettings daemon running in order to pick up the themes and font settings.

One implementation [ON SWAY](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland) is xsettingsd.

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/neomikr0n/dotfiles.git
git push -u origin main
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/neomikr0n/dotfiles.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
…or import code from another repository

Download and set up [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on your Mac. You can get it from the Apple App Store. However, be noted that installing Xcode is long and tedious. It takes 10+ GBs of data to download, then some additional time to set up.
Take your USB to Lightning cable and connect your iPhone to the Mac you’re using.
If you’re connecting the phone to the computer for the first time, you will need to trust the computer. Tap “Trust This Computer” when prompted on your iPhone’s display.
Now, open the Settings app and go to Privacy & Security > Developer Mode.
Turn on the toggle and confirm that you want to enable the feature.

[How to one-line with & ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/12xuacc/how_to_oneline_with/)
FYI - there are a few ways to get bash -c to accept multi-line commands, which sort of bypasses this entirely.

Option 1 - dont close quotes between lines

bash -c "sleep 1000 &
echo 'Say this now'"

Option 2 - use cat<<EOF in a variable substitution. This is sort of nice if you have quotes in the command you are running with bash -c, since you dont need to modify them so that they work nested inside a quoted string.

bash -c "$(cat<<EOF
sleep 1000 &
echo 'Say this now'
EOF
)"

python-numpy: /usr/bin/f2py3 exists in filesystem
python-numpy: /usr/share/licenses/python-numpy/LICENSE.txt exists in filesystem
Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.
```
## FIX:
1. sudo pip uninstall tqdm :
```
Found existing installation: tqdm 4.65.0
Uninstalling tqdm-4.65.0:
  Would remove:
    /usr/bin/tqdm
    /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tqdm-4.65.0.dist-info/*
    /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tqdm/*
```
2. sudo pip uninstall numpy :
```
Found existing installation: numpy 1.23.5
Uninstalling numpy-1.23.5:
  Would remove:
    /home/n30/.local/bin/f2py
    /home/n30/.local/bin/f2py3
    /home/n30/.local/bin/f2py3.10

HSBC
https://www.hsbc.com.mx/tarjetas-de-credito/condiciones-generales/

Hay que tomar en cuenta que HSBC es de los peores bancos en cuanto a atención a clientes, la app seguido falla, al igual que su sistema en general, para todo te mandan a la sucursal, en fin sino tuvieran buenas promos ni siquiera lo hubiera tomado en cuenta. Un consejo para los que la piensen solicitar, es que sí les ofrecen la air, tomenla e inmediatamente después de activarla, llamen para realizar el cambio de producto, casi siempre te ofrecerán la 2now y la zero. En este banco mientras más línea mejor porque por casi todas las compras en línea te realizan cargos doble y sí quieres ocupar el resto de tu línea tienes que esperar minimo 3 días a que se libere.

Hola soy Luis y puedo dar mi experiencia con la targeta hey banco y si puedo aprovechar el 2%  usando la billetera de Google y pagando con el móvil casi no uso la tarjeta ficica todo por contacto

Para llegar a los 2,500, domicilie mi PPR (Plan Para el Retiro), entonces sin pedos cumplo la cuota mensual

VIRSH is a command to directly interact with our VMs from terminal. We use it to list networks, vm-status and various other tools when we need to make tweaks. Here is how we start the default and make it auto-start after reboot.

sudo virsh net-start default

Network default started
sudo virsh net-autostart default

Network default marked as autostarted

Check status with:
sudo virsh net-list --all

- install the VirtIO tools, which can be difficult to track down. My favorite way is to run the exe file from https://github.com/virtio-win/virtio-win-pkg-scripts but many guides use the iso file also provided at this link.

Another good resource for obtaining VirtIO drivers is from the proxmox wiki https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers

- [Enable QEMU Guest Agent](http://wiki.stoney-cloud.org/wiki/Qemu_Guest_Agent_Integration)
Now you need to modify the VM to make use of the guest agent drivers. We need to add the qemu agent channel. Add Hardware -> Channel OR *EDIT CURRENTLY "Channel"* and copy these settings on XML (must be enabled on preferences):
<channel type="unix">
  <source mode="bind"/>
  <target type="virtio" name="org.qemu.guest_agent.0"/>
</channel>

original was:
<channel type="spicevmc">
  <target type="virtio" name="com.redhat.spice.0"/>
  <address type="virtio-serial" controller="0" bus="0" port="1"/>
</channel>

On "details" -> Channel (qemu-ga) should be "state:connected"
