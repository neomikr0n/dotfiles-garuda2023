# configuration file, must be in:

HYPRSHOTGUN_SCREENSHOTS=~/Pictures/Screenshots/
# sets the HYPRSHOTGUN_SCREENSHOTS variable to the path ~/Pictures/Screenshots/.

SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP=$(date "+${HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT:-%F_%H-%M_%S}")
# variable above will generate something like these: ss_2023-04-27_00-50_30.png

# This sets the SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP variable to the output of the date command with a specific format string. The format string is defined using the ${HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT:-%F_%H-%M_%S} syntax. This means that if the HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT environment variable is set, the format string will be set to its value. Otherwise, it will be set to %F_%H-%M_%S, which is a standard format for date and time with the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separated by underscores.

# The + before the format string tells the date command to output the date and time in the specified format. Overall, this script is generating a timestamp for a screenshot filename based on the current date and time, using a custom format if HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT is set or a default format otherwise.

SCREENSHOT_FULLNAME="$HYPRSHOTGUN_SCREENSHOTS"/ss_${SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP}_garuda.png
# This sets the SCREENSHOT_FULLNAME variable to a path and filename for a screenshot image file. By using this naming convention, the script ensures that each screenshot is saved with a unique filename based on previous declared variables making it easy to distinguish between multiple screenshots taken at different times.

# The path is defined by the HYPRSHOTGUN_SCREENSHOTS environment variable, which specifies the directory where the screenshot should be saved. The filename includes the prefix ss_ followed by the SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP variable, which contains a timestamp for the current screenshot in a specific format. Finally, the filename ends with the .png extension, indicating that the screenshot should be saved as a PNG image file.

# By using this naming convention, the script ensures that each screenshot is saved with a unique filename based on the timestamp, making it easy to distinguish between multiple screenshots taken at different times. The .png extension ensures that the screenshot is saved in a standard image format that can be easily viewed and shared.
