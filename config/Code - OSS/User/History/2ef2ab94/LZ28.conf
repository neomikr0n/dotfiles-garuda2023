SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP=$(date "+${HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT:-%F_%H-%M_%S}_garuda")
# This is a shell script that sets the SCREENSHOT_TIMESTAMP variable to the output of the date command with a specific format string.

# The format string is defined using the ${HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT:-%F_%H-%M_%S} syntax. This means that if the HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT environment variable is set, the format string will be set to its value. Otherwise, it will be set to %F_%H-%M_%S, which is a standard format for date and time with the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separated by underscores.

# The + before the format string tells the date command to output the date and time in the specified format.

# Overall, this script is generating a timestamp for a screenshot filename based on the current date and time, using a custom format if HYPRSHOTGUN_DATEFMT is set or a default format otherwise.
