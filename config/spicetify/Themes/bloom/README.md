## Dependencies

- [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) version 2.11.1 or newer. Latest version recommended.
- [Segoe UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe#Segoe_UI) font family, comes pre-installed on Windows Vista and newer.
  Segoe UI versions older than 5.37 (older than Windows 8.0) are not officially supported but may work.

## Automated Installation

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom/main/install.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```

### Linux/macOS (Bash)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimsandu/spicetify-bloom/main/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
    <summary>Special script for Debian users</summary>
<p>Replace `install.sh` in the above command with `install_debian.sh`. Spotify made a derp that it doesn't work on some Debian installations. Passing `--no-zygote` flag to it will fix this issue, which also means we also need to add it to launcher entry. `install_debian.sh` script's whole purpose is to run the `install.sh` as usual, then applying the fix. Issues about it are welcome!</p>

### Spicetify Marketplace

You may also install the theme from the Spicetify Marketplace.
Simply install [spicetify-marketplace](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace) by following it's
installation instructions. Look for `Bloom` theme and install it.

## Manual Installation
Use this guide to install if you're having trouble using the shell commands/installation scripts.

### Step 2

| Platform            | Path                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\Themes`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/Themes`      |

### Step 3

### Step 5
- Navigate to Spicetify's Extensions directory.

| Platform            | Path                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\Extensions`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions`      |

### Step 6
- Go back to the downloaded ZIP file, and extract `bloom.js` to the Extensions directory.

### Step 7
- Open a terminal/command prompt window and type the following commands:
```bash
spicetify config current_theme Bloom
spicetify config color_scheme dark
spicetify config extensions bloom.js
```
...and then apply the theme by typing `spicetify apply`. And you should be done!

<br>

If you encounter any buggy artifacts after applying, type these following commands:
```sh
spicetify config inject_css 1
spicetify config replace_colors 1
spicetify config overwrite_assets 1
```
..then type `spicetify apply` to apply the theme.

## Important

For the sidebar playlists to show properly, ensure that these two lines are added in the Patch section of your `config-xpui.ini` file:

```ini
[Patch]
xpui.js_find_8008 = ,(\w+=)32,
xpui.js_repl_8008 = ,${1}56,
```

## Customization

The available color schemes are: `light` and `dark`. Apply one using the following commands:
```
spicetify config color_scheme <color scheme>
spicetify apply
```

### More Options

- You can change the accent color in the theme folder's color.ini file.  
- If you're using Windows, you can hide the window controls by adding the flag `--transparent-window-controls` after Spotify.exe in your Spotify shortcut.

<details>
  <summary><b>Theme is broken, some visual elements are missing, etc.</b></summary>
<blockquote> Spotify releases updates very frequently, and when that happens, it's common for things to break. Generally, we'll be able to fix these issues, but there are certain issues that are out of our control. If you experience such an issue, please report them via the repository's issues page.

<details>
  <summary><b>Theme breaks after installing a Spicetify addon/app.</b></summary>
<blockquote> This occurs rather because the custom app doesnt exist. Check Spicetify repositories if it indeed exists in that exact package name and open an issue on this repo if it does for a more extended testing. </blockquote>
